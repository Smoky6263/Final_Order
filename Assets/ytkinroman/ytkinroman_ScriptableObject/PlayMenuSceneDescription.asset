  - Radioactive ruins, dusty slums, and mutants clinging to the last remnants of
    a dead world.
  - A ruined highway, cracked asphalt, and a beast that has claimed these lands as
    its hunting ground.
  - Rotting swamps, toxic mist, and biomass that consumes all who dare step into
    its domain.
  - A twisted forest, toxic sludge, and creatures lurking in the shadows, hunting
    anything that moves.
  - Giant rusted factories, toxic air, decayed industrial ruins, and one final chance
    at survival.
